    """

     I've recently completed a full-stack software development program with a specialization in predictive analytics and AI at Code Institute. This formal education, along with my extensive experience as an artist and freelancer, allows me to bring a unique mix of creativity and technical skills to any project.


My journey started in the art world, where I developed a deep appreciation for artistic expression and client satisfaction. This inspired me to learn more about technology and led me to gain proficiency in various programming languages, including front and backend development. Although I lack traditional work experience in the tech industry, my time traveling and managing my own brand has given me invaluable skills in communication, adaptability, and problem-solving.


I'm particularly drawn to pushing the boundaries of innovation and using data-driven insights to create meaningful impacts. I excel at collaborating with diverse teams, quickly learning new concepts, and thriving in dynamic settings. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I'm excited about the opportunity to discuss how my unique background and skills can contribute to innovative projects.
    
Find my resume and the skillset I acquired for your review below, which includes a link to some of my projects.
    
Warm regards,
    
Fernanda Pombo
